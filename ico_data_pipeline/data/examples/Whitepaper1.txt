INVESTMENT MEMORANDUM
Project: EtherLotty
Date: June 15, 2017
Document Version: 1.0

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

EtherLotty is poised to revolutionize the online gaming and lottery industry by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to create the world's first truly transparent and provably fair decentralized gambling platform. Current online casinos and lotteries suffer from a critical lack of trust; users cannot verify the randomness of outcomes or be certain of instant payouts. EtherLotty solves this through immutable smart contracts that automate all game logic and payouts, eliminating the need for a central authority and building unprecedented user confidence. We are seeking 45,000 ETH to fund the final development and global marketing push for our flagship product.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

The $450 billion global online gambling market is plagued by opacity and mistrust. Centralized operators can manipulate outcomes, delay withdrawals, and withhold user funds. Regulatory hurdles limit access for many users, and high fees (often 15-30%) eat into player winnings. There is no verifiable way for a user to confirm that a game has not been rigged against them.

3. OUR SOLUTION

EtherLotty is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Ethereum. Our core product is a suite of blockchain-based games, including:
- Decentralized Lottery: A daily draw where ticket purchases and winner selection are handled by a publicly auditable smart contract.
- Provably Fair Casino Games: Instant games like dice, roulette, and slots where the fairness of each spin or roll can be verified by the user.

All funds are held in smart contracts, and winnings are distributed automatically and instantly upon game resolution. This reduces fees to a flat 2%.

4. TECHNOLOGY

- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Mainnet
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity, fully open-source and audited by a third-party security firm before launch.
- **Front-end:** React.js with Web3 integration.
- **Random Number Generation:** Using a combination of block hashes and Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) for maximum security and unpredictability.

5. TOKENOMICS (LOT Token)

- **Token Name:** LOT Token
- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 LOT

6. TEAM

Our team is composed of passionate individuals with experience in blockchain development and online gaming. Due to the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding blockchain-based gambling in certain jurisdictions, the core development team has chosen to remain pseudonymous at this stage. We believe the code and the product will speak for themselves.
